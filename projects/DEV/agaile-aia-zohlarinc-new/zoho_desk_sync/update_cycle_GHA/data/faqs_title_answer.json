Because on one hand, it is crucial for the urgently needed climate change that we all make an effort, and on the other hand, because solar energy is now the cheapest form of energy. There is no cheaper energy supply than a sensibly sized PV system on your own roof. Depending on electricity prices, this can pay for itself in a few years - on average currently after 5-7 years; with the significantly higher electricity prices of last year, which could potentially return in some form this coming winter, even much faster.
